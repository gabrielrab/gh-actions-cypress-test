<img alt="Logo" align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/1024px-React-icon.svg.png" width="128" />

This is a project that shows the use of automated tests using React + Cypress, and running the tests both in the cli and in a CI process using GitHub Actions.

## Folder structure

- `cypress`: folder containing all test files.
- `src`: default React folder containing application files.
- `.github`: folder containing GitHub Actions workflow file.

## Commands

- `start`: start application.
- `build`: build the application.
- `test`: run tests with Cypress.

## Github Actions

The `ci.yml` file contains all the steps to run the tests in a simple way. You can change it as you like to meet your CI needs such as blocking a PR when tests fail or any other type of validation. [Know more](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

```yml
name: Cypress Tests
